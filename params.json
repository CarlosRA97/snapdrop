Is it a P2P-connection directly from device to device or is there any third-party-server?\r\nIt uses a P2P connection if WebRTC is supported by the browser. (WebRTC needs a Signaling Server, but it is only used to establish a connection and is not involved in the file transfer).\r\n\r\nIf WebRTC isn’t supported (Safari, IE) it uses a Web Sockets fallback for the file transfer. The server connects the clients with a stream.  \r\n\r\n\r\n##### What about privacy? Will files be saved on third-party-servers?\r\nNone of your files are ever saved on any server. \r\nSnapdrop doesn't even use cookies or a database. If you are curious have a look [at the Server](https://github.com/capira12/snapdrop/blob/master/server/ws-server.js)\r\nBut it does use Google Analytics. \r\n\r\n##### Is SnapDrop a fork of ShareDrop?\r\nNo. ShareDrop is built with ember. Snapdrop is built with Polymer. \r\nI wanted to play around with Progressive Web Apps and then I got the idea to clone Apple’s Airdrop. By doing research on this idea I found and analysed ShareDrop. I liked it and thought about how to improve it.\r\nShareDrop uses WebRTC only and isn't compatible with Safari Browsers. Snapdrop uses a Websocket fallback and some hacks to make Snapdrop work due to the download restrictions on iDevices. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Snapdrop is awesome! How can I support it? \r\n* File Bugs, Give Feedback, Suggestions\r\n* Share Snapdrop on your social media.\r\n* [Buy me a cup of coffee](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=R9C5E42UYEQCN)\r\n* Fix bugs and do a Pull Request. This is my first open source project, so I am not very used to the common workflow, but we'll figure it out!\r\n* Do Security Analysis and suggestions\r\n\r\n\r\n## Run the project on your device\r\n* Install npm, bower, gulp and the dependencies as described [here](https://github.com/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit#install-dependencies)\r\n    * `npm install & bower install`\r\n* run `gulp serve`\r\n* In a second shell run `node index.js`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Licences\r\n* Thanks to [Mark DiAngelo]() for the [Blop Sound](http://soundbible.com/2067-Blop.html)",
